# PROG 01: Crunch Time

This app converts the amount of exercise someone does, to the amount of calories it burned by exercising (rounded). It also 
finds out what are the caloric equivalents in terms of other types of exercise (also rounded, because it doesn't make sense to 
do half a pushup, and half a minute doesn't really make a difference). It includes all 12 exercises.
